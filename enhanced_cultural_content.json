    "title": "\"Pravilo\": Ancient Slavic Wisdom Meets Tropical Healing",
    "text": "In the deep Siberian forests, where ancient Slavic shamans once practiced their healing arts, and in the sacred temples of Thailand, where Buddhist monks perfected the art of therapeutic touch, a unique fusion of healing wisdom has emerged. The \"Pravilo\" system represents this beautiful marriage of Russian forest wisdom and Thai temple healing traditions.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the healing practices of Lake Baikal's indigenous peoples and the traditional medicine of Wat Pho temple in Bangkok, \"Pravilo\" is a unique ancient Slavic simulator that allows for deep decompression of the spine and joints. It works through natural horizontal traction, where the impact on the entire musculoskeletal system is evenly distributed under the mass of one's own body (with the possibility of adjusting the load). This helps relieve compression from intervertebral discs, free pinched nerves, and improve blood circulation.\n\nInspired by the forest bathing practices of Russian folk healers and the mindfulness techniques of Thai Buddhist monks, \"Pravilo\" gently stretches muscles, ligaments, and tendons, increasing flexibility and joint mobility. Like the healing waters of Baikal and the therapeutic touch of Thai temple healers, this time-tested method allows you to unleash ancient strength while surrounded by tropical healing energy. The effectiveness of the \"Pravilo\" simulator has been proven by functional research and enriched by centuries of cultural healing wisdom."

    "introduction": "My journey began with an interest in the body and health, studying at a sports college and physical education university in Moscow. But the most important lessons I learned not from books, but from living experience — through travels across Russia's vast landscapes and Asia's sacred healing centers, personal experiments with body and consciousness, and deep immersion in both Russian and Thai healing traditions.",
    "journey": {
      "title": "Life Path: From Siberian Forests to Thai Temples",
      "text": "From a young age, I was drawn to freedom and to exploring the limits of human capabilities. My journey began in the vast landscapes of Russia, where I learned the ancient wisdom of Siberian forests and the healing traditions of Lake Baikal's indigenous peoples. I hitchhiked across Russia and post-Soviet countries, experiencing the traditional healing practices of Russian folk healers and the spiritual wisdom of Orthodox monasteries like Solovetsky and Valaam.\n\nThen I ventured to Asia, where I discovered the profound healing arts of Thai temple medicine at Wat Pho in Bangkok and learned from the traditional healers of Chiang Mai. I visited Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Vietnam, immersing myself in the Buddhist meditation practices and traditional massage techniques that have been perfected over centuries. These travels taught me to blend the forest wisdom of Russian shamans with the temple healing traditions of Thai Buddhist monks, creating a unique fusion of healing practices."
