14:T507,Long ago, in deep forests, wise elders and stern warriors prepared their bodies and spirits for great achievements. Their secret was a special method embodied in the "Pravilo" simulator. This is not just a piece of equipment, but an entire system that puts everything in its place: both in the body and in the mind.

"Pravilo" is a unique ancient Slavic simulator that allows for deep decompression of the spine and joints. It works through natural horizontal traction, where the impact on the entire musculoskeletal system is evenly distributed under the mass of one's own body (with the possibility of adjusting the load). This helps relieve compression from intervertebral discs, free pinched nerves, and improve blood circulation. Simultaneously, it gently stretches muscles, ligaments, and tendons, which increases flexibility and joint mobility.

Want to take your training to the next level? "Pravilo" is your powerful ally. In just a few minutes, you will feel stress and fatigue disappear, replaced by energy, lightness, and harmony. This is not magic, but a time-tested method that allows you to unleash ancient strength and become stronger not only in the gym but also in life. The effectiveness of the "Pravilo" simulator has been proven by functional and practical research.3:["$","main",null,{"className":"pt-20","children":[["$","section",null,{"className":"animated-bg text-white text-center py-32 md:py-40 relative overflow-hidden","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"hero-bg absolute inset-0"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"container mx-auto px-4 relative z-10","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-4xl mx-auto","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-5xl md:text-7xl font-bold mb-6 md:mb-8 leading-tight","children":["$","span",null,{"className":"text-gradient","children":"Unlock your body’s potential.

40:T507,Long ago, in deep forests, wise elders and stern warriors prepared their bodies and spirits for great achievements. Their secret was a special method embodied in the "Pravilo" simulator. This is not just a piece of equipment, but an entire system that puts everything in its place: both in the body and in the mind.

"Pravilo" is a unique ancient Slavic simulator that allows for deep decompression of the spine and joints. It works through natural horizontal traction, where the impact on the entire musculoskeletal system is evenly distributed under the mass of one's own body (with the possibility of adjusting the load). This helps relieve compression from intervertebral discs, free pinched nerves, and improve blood circulation. Simultaneously, it gently stretches muscles, ligaments, and tendons, which increases flexibility and joint mobility.

Want to take your training to the next level? "Pravilo" is your powerful ally. In just a few minutes, you will feel stress and fatigue disappear, replaced by energy, lightness, and harmony. This is not magic, but a time-tested method that allows you to unleash ancient strength and become stronger not only in the gym but also in life. The effectiveness of the "Pravilo" simulator has been proven by functional and practical research.1d:["$","$L3f",null,{"dictionary":{"header":{"logo":"Pravilo.Club","navigation":["About Pravilo","Services & Pricing","Outdoor Adventures","Handcrafted Artisan","Wellness Therapies","Spiritual Practices","Schedule & Booking","Contact"]},"main_content":{"headline":"Unlock your body’s potential.

I studied at a sports college, then at a physical education university in Moscow. But the most important lessons I learned not from books, but from living experience — through travels, searches, and personal experiments with body and consciousness.","journey":{"title":"Life Path","text":"From a young age, I was drawn to freedom and to exploring the limits of human capabilities. For many years, I hitchhiked across Russia and post-Soviet countries, traveling almost the entire southern coast of the country. Then I went further — to Asia. I visited Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam. For a long time, I lived in India and South Korea. These travels taught me lightness, the ability to adapt, and to see beauty in simplicity."},"nutrition_experiments":{"title":"Nutrition Experiments","text":"Yes, nutrition became a real laboratory for me. I tried different systems: vegetarianism, veganism, raw foodism. In the end, I was on a raw food diet for eight years, three and a half of which were pure fruitarianism. Later, I added softer regimes. These years showed me how nutrition affects the body and psyche, energy levels, and clarity of consciousness.\nI practiced long fasts, did cleanses, including with castor oil, and drank fresh juices. All of this was part of a large experiment in self-healing. I realized that the body can renew itself and launch its regenerative processes if given the right conditions."},"current_practices":{"title":"Current Practices","text":"Currently, I combine several directions.\nI work as a massage master — relieving spasms, working through trigger points, restoring body mobility. I have an individual approach: sometimes gently, sometimes deeply, but always with attention to the person.\nI teach the Alpha Gravity system and create Pravilo simulators that help develop strength, flexibility, and ligament health.\nI practice hardening — I walk in shorts and a T-shirt all year round, even in winter.\nI use breathing techniques, prayers, and internal gratitude practices. I believe that health begins not only with the body but also with the soul, with an inner connection to God and the universe."},"other_talents":{"title":"Other Talents","text":"Yes, I cannot limit myself to just one direction.\nI am a musician, playing the jaw harp and harmonica. Music for me is a way to connect with myself and people.\nI engage in handicrafts — creating jewelry from wire and crystals. For me, it's a meditative process in which unique things are born.\nI love to travel — it continues to be a part of me."},"worldview_change":{"title":"Change in Worldview","text":"Yes, there were difficult periods — losing my home, business, family. At some point, I found myself in survival mode. But it was precisely this that made me deeper. I learned to perceive events as facts, not just as emotions. I realized that emotions are energy: they can nourish us, or they can destroy us. It all depends on the quality and direction.\nMy philosophy of relationships, for example, is built on trust and sincerity. I see them as a common “well of energy” from which two people can draw if they care for it together."},"summary":{"title":"Brief Description of the Path","text":"My path is a path of search.
