    "title": "\"Pravilo\": Ancient Russian Method for Modern Healing",
    "text": "The \"Pravilo\" system is a traditional Russian method for spinal decompression and joint health that has been practiced for generations. This ancient Slavic approach to wellness focuses on natural body mechanics and the healing power of gravity and body weight.\n\n\"Pravilo\" is a unique ancient Slavic simulator that allows for deep decompression of the spine and joints. It works through natural horizontal traction, where the impact on the entire musculoskeletal system is evenly distributed under the mass of one's own body (with the possibility of adjusting the load). This helps relieve compression from intervertebral discs, free pinched nerves, and improve blood circulation.\n\nThe system gently stretches muscles, ligaments, and tendons, increasing flexibility and joint mobility. In just a few minutes, you will feel stress and fatigue disappear, replaced by energy, lightness, and harmony. This is not magic, but a time-tested method that allows you to unleash ancient strength and become stronger not only physically but also in life. The effectiveness of the \"Pravilo\" simulator has been proven by functional and practical research, and now it's available in a tropical setting where the natural environment enhances the healing process."

    "introduction": "My journey began with an interest in the body and health. I studied at a sports college, then at a physical education university in Moscow. But the most important lessons I learned not from books, but from living experience — through travels, searches, and personal experiments with body and consciousness.",
    "journey": {
      "title": "Life Path",
      "text": "From a young age, I was drawn to freedom and to exploring the limits of human capabilities. For many years, I hitchhiked across Russia and post-Soviet countries, traveling almost the entire southern coast of the country. Then I went further — to Asia. I visited Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam. For a long time, I lived in India and South Korea. These travels taught me lightness, the ability to adapt, and to see beauty in simplicity."

      "title": "Current Practices",
      "text": "Currently, I combine several directions.\nI work as a massage master — relieving spasms, working through trigger points, restoring body mobility. I have an individual approach: sometimes gently, sometimes deeply, but always with attention to the person.\nI teach the Alpha Gravity system and create Pravilo simulators that help develop strength, flexibility, and ligament health.\nI practice hardening — I walk in shorts and a T-shirt all year round, even in winter.\nI use breathing techniques, prayers, and internal gratitude practices. I believe that health begins not only with the body but also with the soul, with an inner connection to God and the universe."

      "text": "Yes, I cannot limit myself to just one direction.\nI am a musician, playing the jaw harp and harmonica. Music for me is a way to connect with myself and people.\nI engage in handicrafts — creating jewelry from wire and crystals. For me, it's a meditative process in which unique things are born.\nI love to travel — it continues to be a part of me."
