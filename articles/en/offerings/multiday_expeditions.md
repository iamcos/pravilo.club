# Multiday Expeditions (2–3 days)

Expedition format means autonomy, camp craft, and safe logistics in humid tropics. We combine forest and coastal biomes to build resilience, attention, and resource skills.

## Jungle Camping
- Skills: site selection (drainage, wind shadow), suspension systems, food safety.
- Rhythm: early starts, mid-day quiet windows, evening fire session.

## Beach Camping
- Skills: tide awareness, anchoring on sand, wind and salt aerosol protection.
- Benefits: starry sky, sunrise breathing practice, sheltered-bay swims.

## Combined Routes
- Concept: cross the forest ridge to reach the coast.
- Goal: varied load, gait and breath adaptation to surfaces and humidity.

## Wilderness Survival (basic)
- Content: water (filter/boil), fire (spark/ferro), shelters (leaf/log/tarp), signals & navigation.
- Safety: “rule of three” — warmth, water, signal.

### Gear & Logistics
- Pack 35–45 L, tarp/hammock/pad, pot, water filter, headlamp, med kit, dry bags.
- Nutrition: fast and slow carbs, electrolytes, tea.
- Eligibility: prior day hike, no contraindications, informed consent.
