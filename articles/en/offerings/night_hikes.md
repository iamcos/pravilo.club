# Night Hikes

Night routes sharpen terrain perception and audio-visual coordination. We select safe trails with clear navigation and anchor points.

## Goals & Format
- Sensory training: working inside a “dim cone” of light; attentive gait.
- Thermoregulation: cooler air lowers load.
- Atmosphere: night sky, forest/shore soundscape.

## Gear
- Headlamp + spare, reflective accents, light gloves.
- Warm layer/wind shell, closed footwear with tread.
- Water, small snack, whistle.

## Safety
- Redundant-path routing, pace and spacing control.
- Avoid hazardous fords and collapsing edges.
- Comms: buddy structure, regroup points, signal checks.

## Integration
- Breath pauses, stargazing.
- Short stretch at finish, warm tea.
- Sleep hygiene: quiet close of day, no stimulants.
