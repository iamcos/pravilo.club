# Ancestral Circle

A ceremony of honoring ancestors and integrating lineage wisdom. We approach roots with respect and cultural sensitivity.

## Format
- Circle opening: consent, boundaries, prayer.
- Stories and symbols of lineage (voluntary; no retraumatization).
- Gratitude practices and transmitting strength.

## Elements
- Altar: stones/wood/candle (ecological and safe).
- Song/voice: gentle vocal support.
- Silence: time for inner contact.

## Safety & Ethics
- Voluntariness, no pressure.
- No regressive methods without professional framework.
- Cultural care: avoid misusing sacred forms.

## Integration
- Journal insights; write a "lineage thesis" (1â€“2 lines).
- Act of gratitude (letter/service/deed).
- Gentle week for consolidation.
