# Photo Safari

A format for those who want to pair walking with observation and framing. We learn to read light, build composition, and work safely near water and rock.

## Objectives
- Find a story: trail lines, bamboo textures, water surfaces and cascades.
- Stabilization: stance, bracing, shutter/ISO handling.
- Ethics: do not disturb wildlife or damage terrain.

## Routes
- Waterfalls and forest corridors — soft diffused light.
- Coast — contrast, glare, shooting into sunset light.
- Vantage points — panoramas and longer focal lengths.

## Safety
- Buddy spots photographer on slippery sections.
- No entry into fast current or exposed edges without protection.
- Gear control: straps, protection from water and sand.

## Practice
- 3–5 frame series with parameter variation.
- Watch color temperature and dynamic range.
- Mini-integration: select top 10 frames for review.
