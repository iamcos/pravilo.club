# Sacred Fire Ceremony

Work with fire is purification, renewal, and alignment of intention. We blend traditional Slavic elements with careful space preparation and clear safety to create a transformational yet ecologically responsible experience.

## Meaning & Structure
- Purification: symbolic release of old patterns through breath and action.
- Intention: clear formulation of goals and gratitude.
- Shared field: circle, prayer, vocal toning.

## Ceremony Elements
- Fire: natural materials, proper stacking, maintaining steady embers.
- Space: boundaries, wind orientation, safe passages.
- Sound: jaw harp/voice, breath rhythm, state shifts.

## Participant Preparation
- Light meal 2–3 hours prior, hydration.
- Warm layer, closed shoes, individual candle (per protocol).
- Personal intentions: 1–3 concise statements, framed positively.

## Safety & Ecology
- Fire control, extinguisher/water/sand, wind compliance.
- Weather-aware setup, remove flammable litter.
- Leave-no-trace: ash collection and site restoration.

## Integration
- Closing tea and reflections.
- Write insights, gentle morning practice next day.
- Care recommendations (sleep, nutrition, quiet).
