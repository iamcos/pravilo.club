# Wire-Wrapping Techniques

Traditional wire-wrapping securely seats crystals and stones without solder, yielding lightweight, durable constructions.

## Materials
- Wire: copper, brass, silver (dead-soft and half-hard tempers).
- Stones: crystals, agates, local stones, sea glass.
- Tools: flush cutters, flat/round-nose pliers, bench block.

## Core Fixtures
- Frame bezel, cross struts, stone “cage.”
- Reinforcement at stress points; hidden locks.
- Ribbons and spirals for visual balance.

## Ergonomics & Longevity
- Deburr sharp edges; skin-contact radiuses.
- Humidity/salt aerosol resilience: coatings and care.
- Snag check with clothing.

## Custom Orders
- Stone selection by aesthetic/intention.
- Sketch mock and sizing.
- Turnaround and maintenance (reshape/polish).
