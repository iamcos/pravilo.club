### **Updated Plan 2: Research & Context Generation (for Misha's Consideration)**

This plan outlines the information and assets Misha would need to provide to ensure the website accurately reflects his vision and content, with updated considerations.

**1. Content & Media Gathering:**
    *   **Misha's Personal Narrative:** A detailed biography, his philosophy on Pravilo, his journey, and why he is passionate about it. This should be provided as text.
    *   **Video Reviews:**
        *   **Format:** Provide links to videos already hosted on platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, or similar. I cannot directly process raw video files from a hard drive.
        *   **Selection:** Which specific video reviews should be featured?
        *   **Consent:** Confirm that consent has been obtained from individuals in the video reviews for public display.
    *   **Photographs:**
        *   **Delivery:** Provide digital image files (e.g., via cloud storage like Google Drive, Dropbox, or a shared folder).
        *   **Selection:** Which photographs should be used for Misha's section, the services, and general site aesthetics?
        *   **Quality:** High-resolution images are preferred for optimization.
    *   **Additional Text Content:** Any other specific details or unique selling points for Pravilo.Club or Misha's services that are not already in the scraped text.

**2. Booking System Requirements & Preferences:**
    *   **Specific Features:** What are the absolute must-have features for the booking system (e.g., online payments, calendar synchronization, recurring appointments, client management, staff scheduling)?
    *   **Crypto Payments:** Given the current limitations of off-the-shelf booking platforms, Misha needs to decide:
        *   Is direct crypto wallet integration a **hard requirement** for launch, potentially requiring custom development or a manual process?
        *   Or can traditional payment gateways be used initially, with crypto integration explored as a **future enhancement**?
    *   **Budget:** Is there a budget allocated for a paid booking service? (Many robust platforms have subscription fees).
    *   **Existing Preferences:** Does Misha have any preferred booking platforms he has used or researched?

**3. SEO Keywords & Target Audience:**
    *   **Keyword Brainstorming:** Beyond "Pravilo," what other terms would potential clients search for (e.g., "spinal decompression therapy," "back pain relief," "ancient Russian fitness")? Consider these in English, Russian, and Chinese.
    *   **Specific Russian Keywords:** Misha should provide insights into relevant search terms like "русский правило аппарат" and any other local or niche terms.
    *   **Target Demographics:** Who is the primary audience for the website? (e.g., athletes, office workers, specific age groups).

**4. Design & Branding Preferences:**
    *   Are there any specific color schemes, fonts, or overall aesthetic preferences?
    *   Does Pravilo.Club have an existing logo or branding guidelines?

**5. Domain & Hosting:**
    *   Confirm the desired domain name for the website (`pravilo.club`).
    *   Any preferences for static site hosting providers? (e.g., GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify).
