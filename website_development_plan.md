### **Updated Plan 1: Website Development (My Implementation Plan)**

This plan outlines how I will approach building the static website, incorporating your feedback.

**1. Technology Stack Selection:**
    *   **Static Site Generator (SSG):** I will use **Next.js** (React framework) for its excellent performance, built-in internationalization (i18n) support, and strong SEO capabilities.
    *   **Styling:** I will use **Tailwind CSS** for efficient and consistent styling, ensuring a modern and responsive design.
    *   **Hosting:** The final static site can be deployed on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. I will provide the generated static files for upload via FTP if that is the preferred method.

**2. Multi-language Implementation:**
    *   I will leverage the structured English, Russian, and Chinese JSON data I've already generated.
    *   Implement Next.js's i18n routing to handle language switching seamlessly (e.g., `/en`, `/ru`, `/zh`).
    *   Ensure all static text content is dynamically loaded based on the selected language.

**3. Core Website Structure & Content Integration:**
    *   **Homepage:** Engaging introduction to Pravilo.Club.
    *   **About Pravilo:** Detailed explanation of the therapy (using existing structured text).
    *   **Services & Pricing:** Clear presentation of Discovery Session, Alignment Package, and Single Session (using existing structured text).
    *   **Misha's Personal Section:**
        *   Design a dedicated page/section to tell Misha's story and his connection to Pravilo.
        *   **Video Reviews:** I will implement embedding for videos (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo). Misha will need to provide links to externally hosted videos. I cannot directly process raw video files.
        *   **Photographs:** I will integrate provided photographs, ensuring they are optimized for web performance (e.g., responsive images, lazy loading). Misha will need to provide these digital image files.
    *   **Testimonials:** Display existing testimonials prominently.
    *   **Contact Page:** Basic contact information and a form (if a form service is integrated).
    *   **Legal Pages:** Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions (using existing structured text).

**4. Robust Booking System Integration (Requires Backend):**
    *   A truly robust booking system with features like recurring appointments, package sales, client management, and automated notifications **requires a backend**. A purely static site cannot handle this logic directly.
    *   **Proposed Approach:** Integrate a **third-party booking service** that handles all the backend complexity (date/time selection, recurring appointments, package sales, calendar integration, client management data storage).
    *   **Crypto Wallet Payments:** This is the most challenging aspect. Most standard booking platforms integrate with traditional payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal). Direct crypto wallet integration is highly specialized and usually requires:
        *   **Custom Development:** Building a custom payment layer that interacts with crypto payment APIs and then integrates with the booking system.
        *   **Niche Platform:** Finding a rare booking platform that natively supports crypto payments.
        *   **Recommendation:** For initial launch, consider a traditional payment gateway via the booking platform, or a manual crypto payment process, while exploring custom crypto integration as a future phase.
    *   **Client Management:** Client data would be stored securely by the chosen third-party booking platform.
    *   **Telegram Notifications:** Some third-party booking platforms offer integrations or webhooks that can trigger notifications via services like Zapier or custom scripts. A static site cannot send these directly.

**5. SEO Strategy Implementation:**
    *   **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML5 tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.) for better search engine understanding.
    *   **Meta Tags:** Implement dynamic `title`, `description`, and Open Graph tags for each page and language to optimize for search and social sharing.
    *   **Schema Markup (Structured Data):** Add JSON-LD schema for `LocalBusiness`, `Service`, and `Person` (for Misha) to enhance search engine visibility and rich snippets.
    *   **Image Optimization:** Implement responsive images and lazy loading to improve page speed, a key SEO factor.
    *   **Clean URLs:** Next.js naturally supports clean, human-readable URLs.
    *   **Sitemap & Robots.txt:** Generate and configure these files for proper crawling.
    *   **Keyword Research:** Incorporate findings from "русский правило аппарат" and other relevant terms into content and meta-data.

**6. Development Workflow:**
    *   **Scaffolding:** Initialize the Next.js project.
    *   **Component Development:** Build reusable React components for various sections.
    *   **Content Population:** Integrate the JSON data into the components.
    *   **Styling:** Apply Tailwind CSS for visual design.
    *   **Booking Integration:** Implement the chosen booking solution.
    *   **Testing:** Ensure responsiveness, cross-browser compatibility, and verify SEO elements.
